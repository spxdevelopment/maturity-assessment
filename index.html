    <!-- Introduction updated to include research insight about scaling performance -->
    <p>Uncover the strengths and opportunities in your go-to-market strategy. In just a few minutes, you’ll assess your organizational performance across seven critical categories, each rated from None (1) to Leading (5). Our research shows that organizations at Basic and above advance sales performance at a significantly faster rate—making this assessment a powerful first step toward sales excellence. </p>
    <p>Before you begin, review the five-level scale used in this assessment:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left:1.5rem;">
      <li><strong>None (1)</strong> – No formal process in place.</li>
      <li><strong>Emerging (2)</strong> – Early‑stage practices, limited consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic (3)</strong> – Defined processes, moderate adoption.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced (4)</strong> – Mature, optimized practices in place.</li>
      <li><strong>Leading (5)</strong> – Proven, industry‑leading excellence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the end, you’ll receive a personalized report with a visual maturity map, category‑specific recommendations, and actionable next steps to accelerate growth.</p>
